This contains my opinion on what the current starting 11 of FC BARCELONA should like:-

               TER STEGEN
    Roberto     Pique      Lenglet     Alba
             Frenkie    Arthur
                 Vidal        
           Messi       Dembele/Fati
            Suarez/Griezmann
                
 My opinion of the players
 
 TER STEGEN: Though he is not yet above prime Neuer, he definitley is one of the best goalies in the world.
 Semedo: Although he is a fine attacking RB, I think he lacks defensive maturity.
 Pique: He is El Presidente and a leader. I believe that at his best, he is the best CB in the world. I feel he is losing                sharpness due to his age.
 Lenglet: A reliable center back.
 Alba: Has wonderful coordination with Messi and that is enough for him to be in the team.
 Busquets:Has been rightfully called the Octopus. If you watch the game, you won't see Busquets; but if you watch Busquets, you           will watch the entire game.
 Frenkie: A genuine midfield prodigy and has BARCA DNA.
 Arthur: Plays like Xavi and along with Frenkie, I would not take any other pair of midfielders in the world for these two                 right now.
 Messi: THE GOAT
 Dembele: Has electric pace, even though he lacks maturity and discipline. Keeps the opponent defenders at their toes.
 Griezmann: Has not fully settled at Barca, but he is intelligent in the footballing sense of the world and I can't wait to see             him develop coordination with Messi.
 Suarez: El Pistolero is way below his prime and is hugely inconsistent, but he still has got that touch of magic for certain            key moments.
 Vidal: Warrior would be the correct world for this man.
 Roberto: Reliable defensively although he lacks that attacking cutting edge.
